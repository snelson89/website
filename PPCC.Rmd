The **P**(honology), **P**(honetics), **C**(omputation), and **C**(ognition) **Research Group** is led 
by Scott Nelson at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  The research focus of this group is on the relationship between *phonological* and *phonetic knowledge*. We largely approach things *computationally* and are interested in the implications of what we find for general linguistic *cognition*. 

The group meets every other week for two hours. 
Meetings are broken down into three 40 minute chunks.
One chunk is for a group member to share their ongoing work with the group.
Another chunk is for a group member to lead a discussion on a recently published (or pre-print) paper
relevant to the group's interests.
The final chunk is for a group member to teach a skill (programming language, software, mathematical approach, ...).
