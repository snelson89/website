I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.illinois.edu) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
My broad research interests include the phonetics-phonology interface, phonological representations, and computational/model-theoretic phonology.
I received my PhD in Linguistics from [Stony Brook University](https://www.linguistics.stonybrook.edu) in 2024. While at Stony Brook I was also affiliated with the [Institute for Advanced Computational Science](https://iacs.stonybrook.edu/index.php).  I was advised by [Jeffrey Heinz](http://jeffreyheinz.net). Before attending Stony Brook, I received my MA and BA in Linguistics from Michigan State University where I was advised by [Karthik Durvasula](https://karthikdurvasula.gitlab.io). You can find a current copy of my CV [here](pics/cv.pdf). If you would like to find out more information about me, please look around this website or **send me an e-mail:** sjnelson[at]illinois[dot]edu.

When I'm not doing linguistics, I like to {write,record,perform,listen to} music. I spent a decade of my life traveling around in a van with my friends performing music for strangers. My love for all things sound is ultimately what drew me to phonetics and phonology.

> "...the overt aspects of language -- the articulatory actions and the acoustic signal they produce -- cannot be properly understood without reference to the covert aspect of language." - Morris Halle 



## Specific Interests



Language production and perception involve many factors. My research seeks to explain how these different factors interact. Primarily, I am interested in the nature of phonological knowledge and how it interacts with the sensory-motor system. I take the perspective that this is best answered by looking into the computational and representational properties of the transformations between continuous speech data and discrete symbolic mental units. In general, there are three questions to be considered:

1. How do we best characterize the output function? (production)
2. How do we best characterize the input function? (perception)
3. How do we best characterize the mental representations that mediate between the two?

In my dissertation, *The Computational Structure of Phonological and Phonetic Knowledge*, I primarily addressed questions 1 and 3. 
I introduced what I call **The Blueprint Model of Production** which is a computational characterization of the production side of the phonetics-phonology interface. 
It provides an explanation for phenomena like incomplete neutralization and variation in homophone duration without needing to abandon discrete phonological knowledge. 
I also show how articulatory-based representations can be easily generated directly from symbolic strings, which supports more abstract theories of representation. 
My current research plans involve using the BMP to analyze more empirical phenomena and expand the computational side to include a perception aspect. 

Because of the nature of the data, my research has involved both experimental and formal methods. I also work on model-theoretic phonology. In that domain I find myself consistently thinking about process interactions. Most of my abstracts contain some combination of the keywords: ``phonetics-phonology interface``, ``phonological representations``, ``computation``, and ``model-theoretic phonology``.
Lately, I have also been interested in how optionality and variability play a roll in the larger framework I have been developing.
