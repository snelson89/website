I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.linguistics.stonybrook.edu) at Stony Brook University. I am also affiliated with the [Institute for Advanced Computational Science](https://iacs.stonybrook.edu/index.php). My research interests include the phonetics-phonology interface, phonological representations, and computational/model-theoretic phonology. I am advised by [Jeffrey Heinz](http://jeffreyheinz.net). Before attending Stony Brook, I received my MA and BA in Linguistics from Michigan State University where I was advised by [Karthik Durvasula](https://karthikdurvasula.gitlab.io). You can find a current copy of my CV [here](pics/cv.pdf). If you would like to find out more information about me, please look around this website or **send me an e-mail:** scott[dot]nelson[at]stonybrook[dot]edu.

When I'm not doing linguistics, I like to {write,record,perform,listen to} music. I spent a decade of my life traveling around in a van with my friends performing music for strangers. My love for all things sound is ultimately what drew me to phonetics and phonology.

# **Research**

## Specific Interests

Language production and perception involve many factors. My research seeks to explain how these different factors interact. Primarily, I am interested in how the formal phonological system interacts with the sensory-motor system. I take the perspective that this is best answered by looking into the computational and representational properties of the transformations between continuous speech data and discrete symbolic mental units. In general, there are three questions to be considered:

1. How do we best characterize the output function? (production)
2. How do we best characterize the input function? (perception)
3. How do we best characterize the mental representations that mediate between the two?

Because of the nature of the data, my research has involved both experimental and formal methods. I also work on model-theoretic phonology. In that domain I find myself consistently thinking about process interactions. Most of my abstracts contain some combination of the keywords: ``phonetics-phonology interface``, ``computation``, and ``model-theoretic phonology``.
