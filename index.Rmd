Hello. I am a PhD student at Stony Brook University. I am largely interested in Phonology, Phonetics, Speech Perception, and Computational Linguistics. I am advised by [Jeffrey Heinz](http://jeffreyheinz.net). Before attending Stony Brook, I received my MA and BA in Linguistics from Michigan State University where I was advised by [Karthik Durvasula](https://karthikdurvasula.gitlab.io). 

You can find a current copy of my CV [here](pics/cv.pdf). If you would like to find out more information about me, please look around this website or send me an e-mail (which can be found at the top of this page).
