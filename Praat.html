<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Introduction to Praat</h1>

</div>


<hr />
<div id="overview" class="section level1">
<h1>1. Overview</h1>
<p>Praat (pronounced /pɹɑt/) is a free, open-source program created by
Paul Boersma and David Weenink at the University of Amsterdam. It has
many functions, but is primarily used to analyze speech. This site
provides basic information on how to get started using Praat for
linguistic research. Along the way we will do three basic acoustic
analyses: measuring vowel formants, voice onset time (VOT), and pitch
values. I will assume a basic understanding of these concepts. If you
are interested in learning more about acoustic (linguistic) phonetics I
recommend reading <a
href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Acoustic+and+Auditory+Phonetics%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9781444343083">this
book</a> by Keith Johnson, <a
href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo3683670.html">this
book</a> by Peter Ladefoged, or, if you are really ambitious, <a
href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/acoustic-phonetics">this book</a>
by Ken Stevens.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="installation" class="section level1">
<h1>2. Installation</h1>
<p>To install Praat, go to <a
href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/">praat.org</a> and click on the
link in the top left corner corresponding to your operating system. This
will bring you to a page that will guide you through the installation
process.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="recording-sounds-and-working-with-sound-files"
class="section level1">
<h1>3. Recording sounds and working with sound files</h1>
<p>When you first open Praat you will see two windows. One will be
called <code>Praat Objects</code> and the other will be called
<code>Praat Pictures</code>. We will ignore the
<code>Praat Pictures</code> window for now. In the
<code>Praat Objects</code> window you should see a big white box that
says “Objects:”. There should be nothing in there as of right now. The
most important type of object is a <code>Sound</code> object. Let’s
start by learning how to record sounds directly into Praat.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>At the top of the <code>Praat Objects</code> window click
<code>New &gt; Record mono Sound...</code>.</li>
<li>A new window called <code>SoundRecorder</code> should now pop up.
<ul>
<li>If you have a microphone of some type plugged in, you can make sure
it is being used as the audio capture device by making sure it is
selected under “Input source:”.</li>
<li>You can also change the sampling frequency if necessary. It defaults
to 44.1 KHz.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To actually record a sound you can click the <code>Record</code>
button. When finished, click <code>Stop</code>.</li>
<li>You can listen back to what you just recorded by clicking
<code>Play</code>.</li>
<li>If you are satisfied with the recording, you can label the recording
by typing in the box to the right of “Name:”. After doing so, you can
click <code>Save to list</code> which will save your current recording
to the <code>Praat Objects</code> window and allow you to make another
recording or click <code>Save to list &amp; Close</code> which will save
your current recording to the <code>Praat Objects</code> window and exit
out of the <code>SoundRecorder</code> window.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the <code>Praat Objects</code> window you should now see
<code>1. Sound &lt;name of sound object&gt;</code>. You can ignore the
numbering. Every time a new object is added to the list during a single
Praat session that number increases by 1. This means that the same file
can technically show up with different numbers at different times. We
can see how that is the case by saving our sound file, removing it from
the <code>Praat Objects</code> window and then loading the file back
into our workspace. To save a <code>Sound</code> object you can click
<code>Save &gt; Save as WAV file...</code>. There are other file formats
available for saving audio, but WAV is pretty much the universal
standard for our purposes. Save the recording you made somewhere on your
computer where it will be easy to find.</p>
<p>Once you are back at the <code>Praat Objects</code> window click on
the <code>Sound</code> object. In the bottom left corner there is a
button that says <code>Remove</code>. Click this to remove the
recording. The “Objects:” box should now be empty like it was when you
first opened Praat. Let’s now add our recording back into the
<code>Praat Objects</code> window. At the top, click
<code>Open &gt; Read from file...</code>. Open the sound we previously
recorded by navigating to where you saved it on your computer. The
<code>Praat Objects</code> window should now show
<code>2. Sound &lt;name of sound object&gt;</code> (notice the
incremented number).</p>
<p>You can also work with sound files that were not recorded using
Praat. For these types of files, you can open them directly from
wherever they are saved on your computer.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="viewing-spectrograms" class="section level1">
<h1>4. Viewing Spectrograms</h1>
<p>One way to do acoustic analysis of speech is by visual interpreting a
spectrogram. A spectrogram is a visual picture of the speech signal. The
x-axis corresponds to time, the y-axis corresponds to frequency (Hz),
and the z-axis (represented as darkness level) corresponds to
amplitude.</p>
<p>To view a spectrogram of a <code>Sound</code> object, first select
the object you want to view in the <code>Praat Objects</code> window.
Once it is selected, a number of buttons should appear on the right side
of the window. Select <code>View &amp; Edit</code>. After doing so, a
window called
<code>&lt;object number&gt; Sound &lt;name of sound object&gt;</code>
will appear. The top half of this window contains the waveform. A
waveform is the overall amplitude change over time. The bottom half of
the window contains the actual spectrogram. It should look something
like the image below. <br></br></p>
<center>
<img src="Praat/NameSpectrogram.png" />
</center>
<br></br> The default spectrogram settings <a
href="https://twitter.com/lisa_b_davidson/status/698249575317032960">are
not always ideal</a>. You can change the settings by clicking
<code>Spectrum &gt; Spectrogram settings...</code>. This will cause a
window called <code>Spectrogram settings</code> to pop up. I usually
change the view range by adjusting the right box next to “View range
(Hz):” from 5000 to 7500. I also change the dynamic range by adjusting
the box to the right of “Dynamic range (dB):” from 70 to 50. If you mess
around with the settings and suddenly things start looking strange, you
can always click the <code>Standards</code> button on the bottom of the
window to reset all the parameters to their default settings. If you
would like to see what the settings would look like before leaving the
<code>Spectrogram settings</code> window you can click
<code>Apply</code>. As long as the
<code>&lt;object number&gt; Sound &lt;name of sound object&gt;</code>
window is still visible you can see the changes in real time. Once you
change the settings you can click <code>OK</code> to get rid of the
<code>Spectrogram settings</code> window. The updated version of the
spectrogram is shown below. <br></br>
<center>
<img src="Praat/NameSpectrogram2.png" />
</center>
<p><br></br> There are a few other things we can do that may help with
our interpretation of the spectrogram. These are listed below.</p>
<div id="formants" class="section level2">
<h2>Formants</h2>
Formants are the de facto method for measuring basic vowel quality.
Specifically, the first two formants (F1 and F2). Trained phoneticians
can often eyeball the location of the formants, but Praat has an
algorithm for determining a formant value at any location and will show
this if prompted. At the top of the
<code>&lt;object number&gt; Sound &lt;name of sound object&gt;</code>
window click <code>Formant &gt; Show formants</code>. You should see a
bunch of red dots appear, forming lines throughout the spectrogram.
Determining which line corresponds with F1 and F2 is done by counting up
from the bottom. F1 is the first line starting from 0 Hz, F2 is the
second line,, and so on. You can determine the F1 and F2 values at a
given time by clicking on the red dot/line for the formant. A red number
on the left hand side will show you the value. The image below shows an
example of what your window should look like. To get rid of the formant
tracking, click <code>Formant &gt; Show formants</code> again and they
should disappear. <br></br>
<center>
<img src="Praat/NameSpectrogramFormants.png" />
</center>
<p><br></br></p>
</div>
<div id="pitch" class="section level2">
<h2>Pitch</h2>
<p>Pitch can be used for different types of acoustic analysis. For
example, you may want to look at the pitch pattern over an entire phrase
if you are studying the prosody of a language. Or, if you are interested
in the tonal properties of a language, you can look at the pitch
location and shape over a single tone bearing unit. To visualize the
pitch, click <code>Pitch &gt; Show pitch</code>. This time, a blue line
should appear on the spectrogram. You can see what the exact pitch value
is at any given time by clicking at a specific time on the spectrogram.
If pitch can be calculated at that moment, you will see a blue number
appear on the right side of the spectrogram. If pitch can’t be
calculated, you will only see the 75 Hz and 500 Hz limits. The image
below shows an example of what your window should look like. To get rid
of the pitch tracking, click <code>Pitch &gt; Show pitch</code> again
and it should disappear.</p>
<br></br>
<center>
<img src="Praat/NameSpectrogramPitch.png" />
</center>
<p><br></br></p>
</div>
<div id="intensity" class="section level2">
<h2>Intensity</h2>
The final thing you may want to visualize is the intensity. This is
sometimes useful for determining where one segment may start or end. It
also corresponds with the wave form in the top of the window, but is
still helpful in my opinion. To visualize the intensity click
<code>Intensity &gt; Show intensity</code>. If you click anywhere on the
spectrogram, if the intensity value is greater than 50 dB you will see a
green number appear on the right hand side. Otherwise, you will see the
50 dB and 100 dB limits. To get rid of the intensity tracking, click
<code>Intensity &gt; Show intensity</code> again and it should
disappear. <br></br>
<center>
<img src="Praat/NameSpectrogramIntensity.png" />
</center>
<p><br></br></p>
<hr />
</div>
</div>
<div id="textgrids" class="section level1">
<h1>5. TextGrids</h1>
<p>TextGrids in Praat are another type of object in Praat. These are
used to annotate the spectrogram. To create a TextGrid, first select the
<code>Sound</code> object you want to annotate, then click
<code>Annotate - &gt; To TextGrid...</code> on the right hand side of
the <code>Praat Objects</code> window. This will cause a new window to
pop up named <code>Sound: To TextGrid</code>. In the top box next to
“All tier names:” you can type in the name of the tiers you want to add.
You can separate each tier with a space. For our purposes I will create
two tiers: “Word” and “Segment”. The bottom box next to “Which of these
are point tiers?” can be left blank for now. The default type of tier is
an <code>Interval tier</code> which has a starting and ending point. A
<code>Point tier</code> is instead a single point. We will see how these
work later.</p>
After hitting <code>OK</code>, you should notice that there is a new
object in the <code>Praat Objects</code> window called
<code>&lt;object number&gt; TextGrid &lt;name of TextGrid object&gt;</code>.
You can view a TextGrid on its own, but this is ultimately not helpful.
To view it with the spectrogram, make sure that both the
<code>Sound</code> object and the <code>TextGrid</code> object are
selected. Once they are both selected, click
<code>View &amp; Edit</code> on the right hand side of the
<code>Praat Objects</code> window. The spectrogram window will pop up
again but this time it will look a little different. Below the
spectrogram there are two rows that correspond to the tiers of the
TextGrid and on the right hand side you should see a bunch of IPA
symbols. These are for entering IPA symbols while labeling your tiers.
Praat does kind of weird stuff with IPA symbols so I recommend not using
these and instead entering them with your IPA keyboard. You can also get
rid of the IPA symbols completely by clicking
<code>File &gt; Preferences...</code> and then un check the box next to
“Show IPA chart”. Click <code>OK</code> and the IPA symbols should go
away. It should now look like the picture below. <br></br>
<center>
<img src="Praat/NameTextGrid.png" />
</center>
<p><br></br></p>
Let’s populate our tiers now. First we can start with the “Word” tier.
Here, we want to create intervals at the word level. For my recording,
there will be two words: <strong>Scott</strong> and
<strong>Nelson</strong>. There are a few different ways you can mark an
interval on a tier. You can select a tier by clicking anywhere on it.
The active tier should be yellow. Make sure that tier 1 (“Words”) is
highlighted. Then click on the spectrogram a little bit before the
beginning of the word. You should see a dashed red line marking where
you’d like to place a boundary. Before marking it on the tier, it’s good
practice to make sure that you are selecting a point at a zero-crossing.
To do this, click
<code>Select &gt; Move cursor to nearest zero crossing</code>. One way
to create a boundary marker is by clicking the open circle on the
desired tier. A second (and faster) way is to click <code>Enter</code>
on your keyboard. This will create the boundary marker on the selected
tier. Finally, you can click
<code>Boundary &gt; Add on selected tier</code> or
<code>Boundary &gt; Add on tier 1</code>. We can do the same thing for
the end of the word. We now have an interval. You can do the same thing
for other words on your recording. The same process can be used for the
“Segment” tier, but now you just mark the start/stop points of the
segments rather than the words. After completion you should get
something that looks like the image below. <br></br>
<center>
<img src="Praat/NameTextGridFilled.png" />
</center>
<p><br></br></p>
<p>TextGrids can be saved from the <code>Praat Objects</code> window as
well. Make sure that the TextGrid you want to save is highlighted and
then click <code>Save &gt; Save as text file...</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="doing-a-basic-analysis" class="section level1">
<h1>6. Doing a basic analysis</h1>
<p>Now that you have a marked up recording, it is time to do an
analysis. For a simple recording (like my name) it is possible to
perform all the measurements by hand. With the recording of my name you
could find the F1 and F2 values of all the vowels, measure the duration
of stressed vs. unstressed vowels, find the peak intensity of a stressed
/s/ vs. unstressed /s/ in onset, etc… Of course, on this small of a
sample size, doing so would be little more than a fun exercise.</p>
<p>It is much quicker, accurate (to the extent that Praat is accurate),
and scalable if you automate your analysis. Praat has a built in
scripting system that allows you to write custom scripts. We don’t have
time and not everyone enjoys coding so I will not go through how to
<em>write</em> a Praat script here, but you should know how to
<em>run</em> a Praat script as it will save you lots of time!</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning how to write your own scripts in
Praat I would suggest <a href="https://praatscripting.lingphon.net">this
tutorial</a> or <a href="http://praatscriptingtutorial.com/default">this
tutorial</a>. There is also a built in tutorial in the Praat help menu,
but I have always found it to be lacking.</p>
<p>There are many places to find custom scripts online. Some people who
I have borrowed from include <a
href="https://github.com/stylerw/styler_praat_scripts">Will Style</a>,
<a href="http://www.mattwinn.com/praat.html">Matt Winn</a>, and <a
href="https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~cdicanio/scripts.html">Christian
DiCanio</a>. There are plenty more out there.</p>
<p>For this tutorial we will use two scripts that I wrote. We will use
them to analyze vowel and VOT data from the Takestani dialect of
Southern Tati. This is data that was gathered as part of a Field Methods
course at Stony Brook University during the Spring 2022 semester.</p>
<div id="part-1-vowel-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 1: Vowel Analysis</h2>
<p>To begin, download the <a href="Praat/Vowels.zip">data</a> and the <a
href="Praat/vowelData.praat">script</a>. Unzip the folder to find
individual WAV and TextGrid files for ~ 25 words.</p>
