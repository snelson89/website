# Introduction
Markdown is what is called a *lightweight* markup language.
It is the lightweight part that makes it different from something like LaTeX.
In my opinion it is best suited for making quick/small documents like handouts.
One advantage it has over something like MS Word/Google Docs is that you can embed
LaTex style math directly within it. 
At the same time, you can use many html-style commands when necessary. 
If you'd like to follow along/try things out you can use the browser-based markdown editor [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io).

# Some basic commands

## Headings

I thought there were only three levels, but while preparing this tutorial I found
out you can have up to six heading levels. Seems like overkill, but maybe you'll
find a need for it. 

|Command|Result|
|:------|:----:|
|```# ...``` | Heading 1 |
|```## ...``` | Heading 2 |
|```### ...```| Heading 3 |
|```#### ...```| Heading 4 |
|```##### ...```| Heading 5 |
|```###### ...```| Heading 6 |

# This is a top level heading (section)

## This is a second layer heading (subsection)

### This is a third level heading (subsubsection)

#### This is a fourth level heading (subsubsubsection)

##### This is a fifth level heading (subsubsubsubsection)

###### This is a bottom level heading (subsubsubsubsubsection)

## Text

You might want to change how your text looks. Here are some ways in which you 
can do so. 


|Command|Result|
|:------|:----:|
|```**...**``` | **Bold** |
|```*...*``` | *Italic* |
|```***...***``` | ***Bold & Italic***|
|``` `...` ``` | `Code Block` |


> You can also make something a block quote by placing the ```>``` symbol at the 
beginning of the line. If you want a multiline block quote with a line break just use ```>```
with no text in between the two lines.

> You can also have nested blockquotes
>
>> by including and empty line with `>` and then ```>>``` on the following line

## Lists

You can have both ordered and unordered lists. For ordered lists, any number 
followed by a period willdo and Markdown will change to the correct ordering. 
You can also embed up to three levels.

1. Item 1
3. Item 2
    1. Item 2-1
    2. Item 2-2
        1. Item 2-2-1
        3. Item 2-2-2
        2. Item 2-2-3
    2. Item 2-3
2. Item 3

Alternatively, you can use a/b or i/ii in the embedded levels.

1. Item 1
3. Item 2
    a. Item 2-1
    b. Item 2-2
        i. Item 2-2-1
        ii. Item 2-2-2
        iii. Item 2-2-3
    c. Item 2-3
2. Item 3

For undordered lists, just use ```-```.

- Item 1
- Item 2
    - Item 2-1
    - Item 2-2
        - Item 2-2-1
        - Item 2-2-2
        - Item 2-2-3
    - Item 2-3
- Item 3

You can also embedd unordered lists within ordered lists.

1. Item 1
3. Item 2
    - Item 2-1
    - Item 2-2
        1. Item 2-2-1
        3. Item 2-2-2
        2. Item 2-2-3
    - Item 2-3
2. Item 3

## Including Images

This works easiest when the image is in the same folder as the markdown file. 
The basic synatx is `![Image Description](File Name)`.
You may also want to use HTML directly if you need to adjust the size: `<img src="http://....jpg" width="200" height="200" />`
Here is a picture of me in Santa Cruz, CA. 

<center><img src="pics/also-me.jpg" width="200"/></center>

## Links

Links work in a similar way to images: `[Description of link](Link)`.
Here is a link to the [PPCC Page](https://www.scott-nelson.net/PPCC).

## LaTeX Math

If you wrap single `$` around the latex equation you can display math inline like this: $ab \sqsubseteq ab^{k-1}a$.
If you wrap double `$$` around the latex equation you can display math centered like this: $$ab \sqsubseteq ab^{k-1}a$$.


### Beyond

There is slightly more you can do with Markdown, but these are the basics. There is no
all-in-one Markdown program. Its like a programming language in which you can type
up a Markdown document in any text-based program, but you need a separate compiler
to get a pdf or html document. I've used Markdown in R, Google Colab, and Github, but also with 
a program for Mac called MacDown which has realtime updating so you can see
what the output looks like as you are creating your document. The choice is up to you...
